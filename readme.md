# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Naeem

I build **scalable SaaS MVPs** and **AI-powered systems** using **React**, **Laravel**, and **n8n** designed to launch fast, automate complex workflows, and grow with your users.

If you're looking to integrate **AI agents**, **streamline operations**, or launch a **production-ready product**, I help make that happen with clean, reliable, and future-proof code

## What I Do Best

-  **React Frontend Development**  
  Pixel-perfect, responsive interfaces that turn wireframes into engaging user experiences.

- **Laravel Backend Architecture**  
  Secure APIs, scalable databases, and clean backend logic built to grow with your product.

- **n8n Workflow Automation**  
  Automating repetitive tasks, integrating services, and orchestrating multi-agent workflows.

- **AI Agents & LLM Integration**  
  Building intelligent systems using GPT, Claude, or LLaMA powered by LangChain/LangGraph when needed

## Recent Projects

- ✅ **AI-Powered SaaS MVP**  
  Integrated GPT-4 and n8n to automate client workflows, cutting manual work by 60%.

- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Laravel + React Platform**  
  Built for scale 10k+ users with sub-250ms API response times.

- ✅ **Content Automation System with AI Agents**  
  Used LangChain + Firebase for real-time orchestration of AI content pipelines.

## How I Work

- Tackle your **biggest technical risk** first not last.
- Communicate clearly using **Slack, ClickUp**, or your tools.
- Deliver clean, documented code that you **own 100%** (NDA-friendly)
